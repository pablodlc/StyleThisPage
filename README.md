# StyleThisPage

## Instructions

1. Create two files in VS Code and save them to your computer. One file should be called index.html, and the other should be called style.css. These should be in the same folder or directory. You can name this folder something like css-practice.

2. Copy (and save) the following code into your HTML file. This is your starting HTML.

*in the interest of brevity, your time, and my mind, I have not included the code provided in the module*

3. Create CSS styles in your style.css file so that each of the paragraphs of text are formatted with the appropriate styles. Your finished product should look something like the following image:

![](/develop/finished.png)

*I decided to include this image as it's a good point of reference*

4. Upload both your HTML file and your CSS file.

**BONUS**  
Revisit your fan page from the last assignment and add some styles to it using CSS.
